gstreamer1.x-java-swt
=====================

This is a version of gstreamer-java mostly compatible with gstreamer 1.0/1.2.

Originally this code was taken from https://code.google.com/p/gstreamer-java/.

This code represent the SWT-bindings. They are now in there own package
to minimize the depedencies for the core package.


Because there is no gst1-java-core release yet, run mvn install in the gst1-java-core
directory to get the maven dependencies satisfied.
